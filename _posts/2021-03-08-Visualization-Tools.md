Nowadays, it is very important to know how to model data and create visualizations. For that reason, I recommend Qlik Sense and Tableau. There are other important tools that could help you in the data visualization modeling such as Power Bi. Moreover, this is the new abiiliity that you must learn.

In my experience, when I began in this path, I have not idea where to start and how to find information. But, some collegues help me to do some Qlik Sense courses and today, I always choose to work with this platform. Nevertheless, It is necessary to know about other tools.

The world is changing faster and faster, and in the next years this ability will be necessary to illustrate and shown the results to the stakeholders. So, I encorage you to begin this grateful path and make you expert in some visualization tool such as
* [Qlik Sense](https://www.qlik.com/us/lp/ppc/qlik-sense-business/brand?CampaignID=7013z000000it5d&ppc_id=b5tkXiRU&kw=qlik%20sense&utm_content=sb5tkXiRU_pcrid_389320750030_pmt_e_pkw_qlik%20sense_pdv_c_mslid__pgrid_15546617465_ptaid_aud-692673547103:kwd-68438765356&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Qlik_Mexico_Google_Brand_DA_EN&utm_term=qlik%20sense&gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5eCBhCBARIsAEhk4r4fvByck7lMxA_3DFnk4Ydfmke0IY7YI8sxaBJg0gCOQlS5i172C_gaAjPLEALw_wcB){:target='_blank'}
* [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/s/){:target='_blank'}

Just in case, Coursera has a great Tableau specialization, I strongly recommend:
