# About

Being a Financial Manager is exactly what you would think it is like. I used to check financial numbers to find errors, tendencies, patterns and even more. As a part of my current functions, I create dashboards to help the stakeholders to make decisions. The financial industry, nowadays, is under many changes due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and this will impact in the near future.

The biggest problem at this moment is to integrate the new normal with the technology. In other words, how to go to the digital transformation and not suffering in the way. Developing chat bots and doing automations using Python and R programming language could be the beginning, but also taking into considerations the artificial intelligence.

Learning is my passion and for that reason I am constantly improving and reinventing myself. Also, I love to play chess because it maintains my mind alert and thinking in the next move and respecting my adversary. But, not everything is about war and destruction, I like to play collaborative online multiplayer video games with people a long the world.

I am very organize because it makes the life easier. So, I integrate this part of my life to projects by integrating Agile Frameworks such as SCRUM. When I am not at work, I am reading and analyzing sport data, because it is easy to implement data science analysis and get some fun predicting the scores based on the last games.

At the core I am a researcher and a family man who love to have great moments with my family and my pets. Walking the dog and see how it interacts with other people and animals make me have fun most of the time. Having some time looking my cats play around the house and watching funny cat’s video to try to imitate those. My wife is my rock and she helps me to find my way and she makes me do my best all the time.

**Specialties:** *Python, Data Science, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Automation.*

Feel free to reach out to have a funny talk about the new normal, chatbots, machine learning, cloud computing or anything else; don’t forget that we can get it together and thrive.
