# About

Being a Data Custodian and now a Data Platforms Tech Owner is remarkably interesting but complicated since those roles are closely related to Data Management and Governance. Most of the time, I am thinking of new ways to innovate and improve communication between the data foundations teams and data platforms and to understand the business procedures and needs.

Part of my activities are to coordinate, lead and innovate into Data Foundations Platforms' roadmap and to improve them to a self-service solution adopting DevOps practices and evolution to integrate Kubernetes and OpenShift.

The financial industry, nowadays, is under many changes due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and this will impact soon. Being the biggest problem at this moment, the integration of the new normal with technology and the home-office. In other words, how to go to digital transformation, agile frameworks and not suffering in the way. We are now in a big challenging and changing world and it is our must to adapt ourselves.

Learning is my passion and for that reason I am constantly improving and reinventing myself. Also, I love to play chess because it keeps my mind alert and thinking in the next move and respecting my adversary. But not everything is about war and destruction, I like to play collaborative online multiplayer video games with people from all over the world.

I am very organizing because it makes life easier. So, I integrate this part of my life to projects by integrating Agile Frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. When I am not at work, I read and analyze sport data, because it is easy to implement data science analysis and have some fun predicting the scores based on the last games.

At the core I am a researcher and a family head who loves to have great moments with my family and my pets. Walking the dog and seeing how it interacts with other people and animals makes me have fun most of the time. Having some time looking at my cats playing around the house and watching funny catâ€™s videos to try to imitate those. My wife is my rock and she helps me to find my way and she makes me do my best all the time.

Feel free to reach out to have a funny talk about the new normal, chatbots, machine learning, cloud computing or anything else; do not forget that we can get it together and thrive.
