# About me

Hello! I am Dr. Beatriz P. Garc√≠a Salgado, a passionate professional in the field of communications and electronics research and development. My experience spans a wide range of projects and roles, both in academia and in collaboration with governmental and academic institutions.

As a project leader, I successfully directed the development of the "Research and Development of a Pipeline Monitoring System" project, in collaboration with the Mexican Petroleum Institute, an effort that demonstrated my ability to lead multidisciplinary teams and achieve strategic objectives in high-relevance projects.

Additionally, I have contributed as a collaborator in the project "Research for the Classification of Temporary Agricultural Crops in High-Resolution Images using Intelligent Computing Techniques," funded by the CONACYT - INEGI Sector Fund (Mexico). This experience has allowed me to apply my knowledge in digital image analysis and machine learning to address real-world challenges in the agricultural sector.

My involvement in the Committee for the Establishment of Standards for the review of test testimony criteria for the national EGEL+D-ICOMPU exam (Mexico), as well as my contribution as a reviewer of items for this exam, reflects my commitment to continuous improvement in computational engineering education and the development of quality assessment standards.

In addition to my research and academic work, I also serve as a lecturer in subjects such as Deterministic and Stochastic Models, Systems Simulation, and Operating Systems, where I share my knowledge and experience with future professionals, thus contributing to the growth and development of the next generation of engineers.

My areas of expertise include digital image analysis and processing, machine learning, parallel computing, spectroscopy, and remote sensing, among others. I have dedicated my career to exploring new frontiers in these fields and applying innovative solutions to complex problems, with the aim of making a positive impact on society and industry.

As a member of the National Researchers System (SNI - I) of the National Council of Humanities, Sciences, and Technologies of Mexico (CONAHCYT), I am committed to advancing research and innovation in my field and contributing to the development of knowledge and technology at the national level.

My achievements, including recognitions for outstanding results in teacher evaluations and national awards for academic excellence, are a testament to my dedication and commitment to excellence in everything I do.

I look forward to collaborating with you in the near future and continuing to contribute to the advancement of science and technology.

**Specialties:** Digital Image Analysis and Processing, Image Classification, Image Segmentation, Image Super-resolution, Image Compression, Machine Learning, Parallel Computing, Hyperspectral Imagery, Ultrasound Imagery, Spectroscopy, Watermarking, Remote Sensing and signal processing.
