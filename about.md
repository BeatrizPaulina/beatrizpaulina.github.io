# About

Juggling the roles of a Data Scientist Manager and Product Owner is a challenging endeavor. It demands a seamless blend of the data science realm with project management, often necessitating collaboration with multiple teams across different business sectors. The goal is to crystallize the ideal product definition and subsequently ensure its successful execution within the development team. Contrary to popular belief, planning and generation are intricate processes, requiring immense patience and a strong foundation in design thinking methodologies.

A significant portion of my responsibilities centers around coordinating, leading, and charting the course for a multi-disciplinary, high-performance team of Data Scientists. My primary goal is to challenge and transform the bank's misconceptions about generative artificial intelligence technologies. By adopting and implementing various LLM models, I aim to usher the banking industry into a new era—one where this groundbreaking technology is harnessed for the betterment of both customers and employees.

The financial industry is currently undergoing significant shifts, particularly due to the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most pressing challenge is navigating the "new normal" – integrating remote work with technology. In essence, the question is: how can we achieve digital transformation and implement agile frameworks without stumbling along the way? We are undoubtedly in a dynamic world, and adaptation is imperative.

I have an insatiable passion for learning, which propels me to continuously evolve and reinvent myself. Outside the professional realm, chess captivates me – it sharpens my strategic thinking and cultivates respect for opponents. Yet, not all games are about conflict; I relish collaborative online multiplayer games, connecting with individuals globally.

Organization is intrinsic to me; it's a tool that simplifies life. I seamlessly blend this trait into my professional projects by integrating Agile Frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. In my leisure time, I delve into sports data analysis – it's fascinating to apply data science techniques and predict game outcomes based on historical performances.

At my core, I'm a curious researcher and a dedicated family man. I treasure moments with my loved ones, whether it's watching my dog interact with the world or mimicking playful antics inspired by amusing cat videos with my feline companions. My wife stands as my unwavering pillar, constantly motivating me to reach greater heights. Moreover, I am the proud father of a beautiful and incredibly intelligent daughter who reminds me daily of the reasons I strive to improve every day.

Feel free to connect! Whether you want a light-hearted discussion on the new normal, chatbots, machine learning, cloud computing, or any other topic – remember, collaboration is the key to thriving.
